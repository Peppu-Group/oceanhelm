## What is Vessel Tracking
Vessels are important in the global economy, since they are essential for moving majority of goods by sea and establishing international trade. This is termed [maritime transportation](https://windward.ai/glossary/what-is-maritime-transport/). Vessels can re-enter trade routes, generate revenue, create jobs for skilled Nigerian workers, etc. It carries about [80% of the world's trade](https://unctad.org/news/shipping-data-unctad-releases-new-seaborne-trade-statistics#:~:text=Maritime%20transport%20moves%20over%2080,transport%2C%20trade%20and%20investment%20policies.&text=UN%20Trade%20and%20Development%20(UNCTAD)%20released%20on%2015%20April%20new,resilience%20are%20redefining%20the%20sector.).

Asset tracking is essential for a sector that contributes significantly to the global economy. Hence, vessel tracking provides real-time visibility into vessel movements, ensuring security, improving efficiency, compliance, and customer satisfaction. This can be done using different monitoring systems like: [Automatic Identification System (AIS)](https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/automatic-identification-system-overview), Satellites, [Radar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/tracking-radar), [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System), and [Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/enforcement/vessel-monitoring)

## Why Vessel Tracking is Important
In vessel tracking, we can know in real-time what our vessel is up to. The importance of vessel tracking is enormous; here are a few.

### Security and Safety
With the advancement of technology, marine meteorology can now predict weather conditions and monitor the climate for harsh conditions. This allows us to ensure our vessels are safe and don't run into harm's way, like collisions.

With efficient monitoring, we can track vessels and respond to threats and emergencies faster. For instance, in the case of sea pirates and other attacks, security personnel can determine the attack's location. Also, rescue teams can determine a rendezvous point for better rescue outcomes.

### Customer Satisfaction
Vessel tracking improves the global supply chain visibility, hence improving coordination between all parties involved in shipping. Hence, when the shipped goods get to the customer on time, we have satisfied customers.

### Efficiency Improvement
This tracking advantage is what we'd discuss in more detail in this article. Vessel tracking improves maritime operations and logistics. With vessel monitoring systems like [OceanHelm](https://oceanhelmtech.com), teams can maintain a real-time view of their entire fleet, allowing them to schedule all operations accurately. For instance, in shipping, we can identify busy shipping lanes or ports and vessel operations.

## Vessel Operations Tracking before OceanHelm
Vessel operations tracking is a branch of vessel tracking that focuses on vessel operations. Before OceanHelm, teams would record the status of their vessels and schedules on paper or untracked documents. What ensued from this are disputes, especially during [vessel leasing since they are structured as a time charter](https://www.voyagerportal.com/resources/voyage-charter). For instance, the ship owner and charterer may agree on demise time, what happens when the vessel is used more than the demise time, and the document isn't updated?

This is why we have built the Vessel Log Module in OceanHelm. Let us explore this module and why OceanHelm does it better.

## Why OceanHelm does it Better
OceanHelm is a purpose-built all-in-one platform, which is how OceanHelm does it better. Since all our modules are interconnected, the end of a lease (hire) from the vessel dashboard logs it in our vessel log. In the vessel log, each action is recorded as a cycle where the cycle begins when the vessel is marked 'Active' and closes when the vessel is marked 'Inactive'. However, we don't implement [circular logging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/circular-logging), since we don't overwrite each log circle.

OceanHelm records sub-actions for each cycle, too. For instance, when a vessel is 'Active' or on lease, it can also be in port for maintenance; OceanHelm records all of these actions. If you want to see in detail how OceanHelm tracks and manages these actions and subactions, send an email to `oceanhelm@peppubuild.com` for a free demo call.

## Conclusion
In this article, we have explored vessel tracking, what it is, and its benefits. We have also discussed vessel operation tracking as a branch of vessel tracking and how OceanHelm is well-suited for this type of tracking. OceanHelm is a maritime software (vessel monitoring system) that aims to digitalize marine operations. With our cloud model and modules, we implement automation and artificial intelligence for operations tracking and efficiency. OceanHelm is built by marine engineers for the maritime sector.
